# COHORT - Petition App

“A group of people with a shared characteristic.”
or
“An ancient Roman military unit, comprising six centuries, equal to one tenth of a legion.”

## Project Scope
Cohort is a platform for people and organisations to create and share petitions with audiences around the globe and promote social awareness. The aim is to connect people across geographic and cultural borders to support causes they care about.

Petitions that receive enough support can then drive decision makers (Local Councils/Local MP’s) to start campaigns, mobilise supporters, and work with other decision makers to drive solutions at local, national and global level.
